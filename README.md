# 🛒 Custom Product Comparator

This Java project demonstrates how to create and use a **custom comparator** to sort objects based on multiple criteria. It defines a `Product` interface, a concrete implementation `DefaultProduct`, and a `CustomProductComparator` class that implements sorting logic by **category name**, **price**, and **product name**.  

The project also includes a `Main` class to test and display sorting behavior, making it an excellent example of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and practical use of **Java Collections Framework**.

## 🚀 Features

- Implements a **Product interface** with basic product properties (ID, Name, Category, Price).
- Provides a **CustomProductComparator** that:
  - Sorts first by category name (alphabetically).
  - Then by price (ascending).
  - Then by product name (alphabetically) if the above are equal.
- Demonstrates usage of `Comparator`, `List`, and `Collections.sort()`.
- Follows clean code and modular design principles.
